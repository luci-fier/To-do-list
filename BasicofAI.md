## 3. Types of AI
AI can be categorized based on functionality and complexity:

### 3.1 Narrow AI (Weak AI)
Narrow AI specializes in performing specific tasks efficiently. Examples include voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, recommendation systems on platforms like Netflix, and chatbots. It is designed for a single purpose and cannot operate beyond its predefined scope.

- **Examples:**
  - Google Translate for language translation.
  - Chatbots for customer service.
  - Recommendation systems on e-commerce websites.

### 3.2 General AI (Strong AI)
General AI is a theoretical concept where machines possess the ability to perform any intellectual task a human can do. These systems would have cognitive functions, including reasoning, problem-solving, and learning, across various domains. Strong AI remains under research and development.

- **Key Characteristics:**
  - Human-like reasoning and adaptability.
  - Ability to understand and process diverse tasks without explicit programming.

### 3.3 Super AI
Super AI surpasses human intelligence, excelling in creativity, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence. It is a hypothetical future stage of AI development and raises significant ethical and societal concerns. If achieved, super AI could revolutionize all aspects of life but might also pose existential risks if not controlled.

- **Potential Risks:**
  - Loss of human control over systems.
  - Ethical dilemmas in AI autonomy.
